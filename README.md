# CellSeg_Benchmark

## Overview

Cell segmentation is a fundamental step in many biological studies, enabling the precise delineation of individual cells from raw data. Traditional approaches primarily rely on image-based inputs (e.g., fluorescence or brightfield microscopy), but emerging technologies—such as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics—introduce omics-derived spatial features as additional or alternative inputs. To bridge these two paradigms, this benchmark systematically evaluates 16 cell segmentation methods that accept either image data, omics data (e.g., gene expression matrices with spatial coordinates), or both.

Accurate cell segmentation unlocks a wide range of downstream biological applications: from quantifying cell morphology and phenotyping heterogeneous populations, to dissecting tissue microenvironments, tracking cell-cell interactions, and enabling spatially resolved single-cell analyses in diseased tissues. By providing a fair and reproducible comparison across diverse datasets (including synthetic and real-world benchmarks), this repository aims to guide method selection for researchers and highlight strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms—ultimately accelerating discoveries in developmental biology, oncology, and neuroscience.

To address this gap, we systematically evaluated 16 cell segmentation methods (covering image‑driven, omics‑driven, and hybrid approaches) across 13 cross‑platform datasets and 20 cross‑tissue (Xenium & MERFISH) datasets, performing 300+ distinct segmentation tasks to quantify accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Our results show that methods integrating omics information achieve superior boundary refinement but suffer from low processing throughput; image‑based methods deliver high morphological accuracy when staining is good, yet perform poorly in transcript assignment in weakly stained or crowded regions. Three additional challenging scenario tests (downsampling, using highly variable genes instead of the full transcriptome, and ultra‑large‑scale datasets) further revealed bottlenecks in accuracy and memory consumption. Based on these findings, we analyzed key influencing factors and provide method selection guidelines, an executable pipeline, and an interactive online platform to help users optimize segmentation strategies according to their specific data characteristics.
